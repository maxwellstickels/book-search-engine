## Overview
The Book Search Engine is an application which allows users to browse information on books, and save (or "bookmark") information on titles that interest them. The user's selections are maintained via an account system; each user's saved books are stored server-side, to give the app a more permanent means of storage.

The original provided code for this app instead relied on client-side localStorage, which is much less likely to store the necessary information permanently.
## Programs Used
The provided website was designed with HTML 5, CSS 3.0, and Javascript (2020 Build) in Visual Studio Code 1.58.2. In addition, the website makes use of the MERN full-stack option, in which Mongoose, Express, React, and Node libraries are connected via an Apollo server.
